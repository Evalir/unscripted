So far, the week consistent of a bunch of different calls talking to people for work opportunities. It truly feels a little weird having people reach out to _me_, rather than me being the one who is trying to get on other people's doors, but it also feels nice, and the week ended on a great note.

The weekend, in turn, was a bit more relaxedâ€”it's been F1 2020 practice over the Melbourne track to get the basics down, and some bass playing, along with finishing my last university assignments. Feels good!
