The weekend was very relaxed—I did a really small, socially distanced get-together with my friends, played some games, studied a little bit, and kept reading my current book. I've been trying really hard not to do work-related stuff on the weekend, mainly because I wanna avoid heavy burnout like the one I had at the end of the year, and at the end of 2018 (I should write about this at some point).

One positive thing over these past couple of weeks is that I've been kinda reaching a balance of the things I'm doing—though I can still manage my time better, I'm having exercise, work and play time, so my happiness level is generally higher. I still feel I could "create" more though, and that's kind of been the rut I have to get over, as it has been there since a long time. I'll figure it out eventually, but for now I'm really focusing on making the current things I have going stick.

On the dev side, I've been learning a bunch of AWS stuff; I wasn't exposed too much previously to it, and as it's used in my current job I figured I'd rather learn the things that concern me sooner than later—being mostly Cloudfront, EC2, Route 53, DynamoDB, S3, and Elastic Beanstalk. It's stuff that I really like, but at the same time don't pay that much attention to as I mostly focus on frontend stuff. It's nice to have something to chew on after some time of not learning anything _completely_ new.
