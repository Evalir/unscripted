Finally getting on track for 2021 "intentions" (goals, if you'd like), and they're mostly a continuation of what I had planned for 2020, but stopped due to the pandemic. Mainly getting fit, keep on making music and growing as a developer. As of right now, I'm chugging down an DB course on Frontendmasters.

I've also been trying to organize my time better, as a huge chunk of it is now free, as I finally finished all my university assignments, and I'm finally done with it, forever. A lot of people seem to struggle with it (for what I've been hearing from friends), but honestly, I think it's all about habits and I'm already used to trying to optimize my time. I'm not trying to squeeze every single ounce of producitivity thoughâ€”I need my time to be lazy and just listen to music. That mainly occurs on weekends, to be fair.
