Woke up late, and so far I've spent the day reading some articles from [Sid](https://sid.st/) (developer at Codesandbox) and watching some talks on [building nice things](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4anAwXYqLG8). Currently trying to resist the urge to program and instead just keep learning 1612 by Vulfpeck.
