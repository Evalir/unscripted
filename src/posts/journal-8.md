I waited for a week before even journaling just to see what 2021 would start like. It's 1:10AM, 8th of January, and I have to say, it's already been kinda turbulent: I [left my job](https://twitter.com/cryptoyizus/status/1347209161784909825?s=20), and Capitol Hill was invaded by far-right sympathizers.

I still have optimism thoughâ€”We're only just starting, and a change is due by January 20th. I think the world may get a breather soon. And for my job situation, I'm taking it slow, but also already on the move as well. The extra downtime is being very useful for errands!
