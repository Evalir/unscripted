Today's one of those days for me where I executed everything perfectly: the morning routine was on point, I had no brain fog and was able work away uninterrupted, It wasn't too hot, I ate the right things and got a good workout in. Complete zen. Now I'm reading [something](https://engineering-management.space/post/leveling-up-developers/) from the Engineering Manager Blog before I go to sleep.
