It's been a few days of just having family time and trying to stay away from my computer as much as possible. I also read a very interesting [fable](https://www.nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.html), which teaches how easy it is to overcome _primordial evils_ (problems) that we've grown accustomed to in our lives. Also, there's gonna be announcement I'll be making tomorrow.
