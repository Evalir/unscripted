I'm sitting in my room, listening to [Laura Deming talk about longevity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GtGlblrBMCU&t=3s), and thinking about different things about watching the last sunset of 2020. To a lot of us (me included) this is a year we'd like to leave behind, even though for me it was indeed net positive, no matter if it still leaves a bad smell. Here's to a better 2021 for humanity!
