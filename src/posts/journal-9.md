Busy week ahead. Lots of miscellaneous todos, and also finishing last things for university. My todo list is quite long, which isn't usually the case, but I still managed to get a strong start today. Maybe if I started drinking coffee I'd fare better in terms of wakefulness.

On the other hand, Crypto crashed like 30% today midnight. That was fun. Still positive it's gonna climb another time before it just goes down—at least bitcoin. Ethereum has stil a lot of momentum, and I can't really see the ecosystem spiraling to death right now. I'm using common sense though—I'm not a trader, so I have stop losses set up if a black swan scenario happens.
